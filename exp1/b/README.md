Experiment 1b
=============

Thank you for agreeing to help me generate data for my work. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

In this experiment you start in the bottom lane, driving the pink car. The car in the top lane will try to change lanes as early as possible

In each round of the experiment a sub-objective will appear at the bottom of the screen. This can be:

* "Drive as if in a rush" or 
* "Drive considerately"

You should keep this sub-objective in mind during the round.
Also keep in mind that neither car has indicators in this experiment, so use the orange car's motion to infer their intent.

Your goal in each round is to stay in your lane while the other car executes their manouvre.
The other car on the road has their own sub-objective, which will affect how they respond to your car. 
The lane change is completed if you and the other car end up in the same lane, heading to the right.

Start the experiment by runnning the following command

```
python3 exp1b.py
```

Each round is expected to last about 20 seconds
The experiment will run for 60 rounds and is expected to take around 20 minutes. 
At the start of each round the simulation is paused and, when you are ready to proceed, you will press the SPACE button to begin 
the round (this is a bit finicky, sorry).

Thank you again for your participation.
