Experiment 1a
=============

Thank you for agreeing to help me generate data for my work. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

In this experiment you start in the top lane, driving the pink car. The car in the bottom lane will stay in its lane.

In each round of the experiment a sub-objective will appear at the bottom of the screen. This can be:

* "Drive as if in a rush" or
* "Drive as if on a leisurely drive"

You should keep this sub-objective in mind during the round. 
A score will appear above the sub-objective. This score is related to your sub-objective, it will start at 200 and decrease
if your behaviour does not match the sub-objective. This score is not recorded and is purely to help clarify the sub-objective.

Your goal in each round is to change lanes as early as you deem feasible.
The other car on the road has their own sub-objective, which will affect how they respond to your car. 
The lane change is completed if you and the other car end up in the same lane, heading to the right.

Start the experiment by running the following command

```
python3 exp1a.py
```

Each round is expected to last about 20 seconds.
The experiment will run for 60 rounds and is expeced to take around 20 minutes in total.
At the start of each round the simulation is paused and, when you are ready to proceed, you will press the SPACE button to begin
the round (this is a bit finicky, sorry).

Thank you again for your participation.
