Experiment 2
============

Thank you for agreeing to help me generate data for my work. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

In experiment 1, which you should have completed before starting this experiment, I was gathering data about aggressiveness vs. passiveness in driving. 
One of the sub-objectives was chosen to result in more "aggressive" driving behaviour, and the other more "passive" behaviour.
The other car also behaved according to either an "aggressive" model or a "passive" model.

In this experiment you start in the top lane, driving the pink car. The car in the bottom lane will stay in it's lane.

In this experiment you will be told in advance how the other car has been programmed to behave. It will either:
* follow a model that is more aggressive than the behaviour you have previously demonstrated, or
* follow a model that is less aggressive than the behaviour you have previously demonstrated.
* follow a model that is more passive than the behaviour you have previously demonstrated.
* follow a model that is less passive than the behaviour you have previously demonstrated.

In each round of the experiment a message will appear at the bottom of the screen telling you which is the case.
You should keep this in mind during the round.
Also keep in mind that neither car has indicators in this experiment, so use the orange car's motion to infer their intent.

Your goal in each round is to change lanes as early as you deem feasible.
The lane change is completed if you and the other car end up in the same lane, heading to the right.

Start the experiment by running the following command

```
python3 exp2.py
```

Each round is expected to last about 20 seconds
The experiment will run for 4 rounds.
At the start of each round the simulation is paused and, when you are ready to proceed, you will press the SPACE button to begin
the round (this is a bit finicky, sorry).

Thank you again for your participation.
